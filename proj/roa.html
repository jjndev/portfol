I have created a number of mods, and guides for modding
'Rivals of Aether', A 'Smash-Bros'-like fighting game. 
A couple of my projects have been listed below.

        A custom character created to fit with 'Rivals of Aether's existing cast and setting. 
        Ep​inel is a sloth with the power to control 'inertia'. 
        <br>The base game was modified to support a new status effect, 
        jumping physics and unique attack mechanics. 
        <br>The character has been present in a number of 'Rivals of Aether' 
        tournament events hosted by the official developer staff.

    <h6>'Pl​usle and Min​un' Additional Character Mod</h6>
    <video width="100%" height="auto"

        A Duo character inspired by 'Pikachu' and 'Ice Climbers' in 'Super Smash Bros.'. 
            Pl​usle and Min​un are a two-in-one, teamwork-focused character. 
            <br>Care went into making an AI teammate that follows the leader character, 
            without ignoring important player inputs like dodging or attacking.
            <br>Created for a one-month jam event, in collaboration with artist and design lead
            <a href="https://twitter.com/THCGourami" target="_blank">Tom Chiacu</a>.
            <br>Pl​usle and Mi​nun (c) Nin​tendo, The Pok​émon Company.
