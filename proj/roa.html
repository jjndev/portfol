I have created a number of mods, and guides for modding the indie videogame
'Riva​ls of Aeth​er', A 'Smash-Bros'-like fighting game. 
A couple of my projects have been listed below.

        A custom character designed from scratch to fit 'Riva​ls of Aeth​er's existing cast and setting. 
        <br>The base game was modified to support a new status effect, 
        jumping physics and unique attack mechanics. 
        <br>The finished character has been present in a number of 'Rivals of Aether' 
        tournament events hosted by its official developer staff.

    <h6>'Pl​usle and Min​un' Additional Character Mod</h6>
    <video width="100%" height="auto" 
    defaultMuted="true" muted="true" preload="false" autoplay="true" loop="true" volume="0">

        A two-in-one character inspired by 'Pikachu' and 'Ice Climbers' from the game 'Super Smash Bros.'. 
            <br>Care went into making a complex CPU teammate that follows the player character, 
            without ignoring important player commands like dodging or attacking.
            <br>Created for a one-month jam event, in collaboration with artist and design lead
            <a href="https://thcgourami.itch.io/" target="_blank">Tom Chiacu</a>.
            <br>Pl​usle and Mi​nun (c) Nin​tendo, The Pok​émon Company.
