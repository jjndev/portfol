    A multiplayer fan-game, originally developed to learn the ins and outs of C# 
    and database handling. 
</p>
<small>
    <p><small>The game is played through both text commands and Discord's built-in interface 
    features. Players can choose one out of hundreds of monsters, and train them by 
    battling them or chatting on Discord servers.</small></p>
    
    <p><small>MysteryCord's battles build upon the source material. It lets players 
    pick formations, hide for cover, and counter incoming attacks with their own. It 
    features co-op battles against AI-controlled teams of monsters, as well as 
    Player-vs-Player matchmaking across separate Discord Servers.</small></p>
    
    <p><small>The game has since been maintained for 5 years with support from its players, 
    hosted on a Linux virtual server. MysteryCord uses the Discord API (with the 
    DSharpPlus wrapper) for Discord account handling and interactivity, SQLite 
    for database handling, and ImageSharp to generate battle images.</small></p>
